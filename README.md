# lds-coi
WIP dataset collecting information about conflicts of interest in the LDS church hierarchy

# Contributing
Forks + pull requests are welcome, and the preferred way to submit data.

## For those unfamiliar with git / Github
If you don't have time / interest in learning, just download the CSV files (click the file -> Raw -> Right click -> "Save As..."), and open them with Excel, LibreOffice, etc.

To contribute changes:

- Ignore the warning that the program will give you about the CSV format; make sure you save it as CSV!
- Open the CSV program with a plain text editor like Notepad, and copy the new lines you created
- Create a new issue in this repository (the Issues tab), and paste your new data in the comment

# Formatting guidelines
(please add to these as you encounter potential discrepancies, so that others can follow the same pattern)

## Abbreviations
To make the datasets match, please use the most common abbreviations that would be known in the LDS community, and include the following period. For example, "Gordon B. Hinckley" instead of "Gordon Bitner Hinckley" or "Gordon B Hinckley"
